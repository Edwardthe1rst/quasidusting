QuasiDusting (Fabric)
=====================

Overview
--------

This Fabric mod modifies Minecraft's quasi-connectivity (QC) behavior, making it **directional and toggleable** by using redstone on a QC affected block. Using this, you can control which faces of QC-affected blocks are influenced by redstone signals a block away!

How It Works
------------

*   **Right-click** a QC-affected block with redstone dust on the face you want to be affected.
*   **Shift-Right-click** to place redstone dust normally, without modifying the block's QC state.
*   Quasi-connectivity only activates from the faces where redstone dust has been applied.
*   This feature allows for easier, sensible, more compact, and more diverse redstone contraptions.

_A variety of examples: The piston and dropper are active because they are quasi-connected to the lever, while the sticky piston is inactive because quasi-connectivity is disabled by default._

Compatibility
-------------

*   This mod **should** be compatible with most other redstone mods.
*   However, full compatibility has not been extensively tested.
*   If you encounter bugs or compatibility issues with other redstone mods, please report them on the [Github Page](https://github.com/Edwardthe1rst/quasidusting/issues) or in the issues tab.
